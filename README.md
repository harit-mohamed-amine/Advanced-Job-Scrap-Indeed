# Advanced-Job-Scrap-Indeed
Extract only wanted jobs, containing wanted words in each job description.

What you'll get:  
In the first line, you'll get statistics of the most used words in the first 10 job posts.  
In the rest of the lines, you'll get `date + ";" + job_link + ";" + title + ";" + company_name + ";" + location_name + ";" +  salary + ";" + contained wanted and unwanted words, each in it's own phrase`

I've put the code behind [uvencer.com](http://uvencer.com), you can get more affined jobs directly from there.
